This repository contains the official implementation of **bpartis** â€” a Bayesian deep neural network for nanoparticle instance segmentation. 

## Demo

Try an in-browser demo on your electron microscopy images [here](https://imagedataextractor.org/demo).

## Usage

If you would like to use a pretrained **bpartis** model, we strongly recommend using [imagedataextractor](https://github.com/by256/imagedataextractor) to do so.

```python
import cv2
from imagedataextractor.segment import ParticleSegmenter

image = cv2.imread('<path/to/image>')  # PIL can also be used
segmenter = ParticleSegmenter()

segmentation, uncertainty, _ = segmenter.segment(image)

```

More detailed information can be found in the imagedataextractor segmentation [documentation](https://imagedataextractor.org/docs/segmentation).

## Training

If you are interested in training **bpartis** to reproduce our results, follow these steps:

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/by256/bpartis.git
```

2. Install requirements
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Training BPartIS

3. Download the EMPS dataset from [here](https://github.com/by256/emps).

4. Train the BPartIS model on the EMPS dataset.

```bash
python bpartis/train.py --data-dir=<path/to/emps/dir/> --device=cuda --epochs=300 --save-dir=bpartis/saved_models/
```
